imgarray (Python)
---------------------------------------

This saves 2D numpy arrays as png images.

Q: Why would you ever want that?

* It's somewhat, though not extremely, space-efficient.
* Saving and loading PNGs is supported by many languages, so all you need to do is port this library.
* Results look kind of funny, nothing too interesting though.
* Because you can.
